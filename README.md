# Star Wars plot Generator 

This project developed for generating plot using Sta Wars API which is freely provided. The project loads the resources from the API searches in the searchable pages and concatinate each resource type together and provide them to the user so the user can select from them to generate the plot.The user selects among the availible resources and  generates the plot. <br />

This is the very first release of the App, and can be still improved.<br />

Task description:<br />
By using the Star Wars API (https://swapi.co/documentation), create a little story generator app.\
The API includes different resources like planets and people, which are also searchable.\
The app is capable of searching through those resources and to add them to the plot.\
At least two resource types should be available in the app (e.g. planets and people). Furthermore, a plot consists of a title and a short description. Stories don't need to be saved.

Technical constraints:<br />
JavaScript Framework: React<br />
